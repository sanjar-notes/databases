Most of this was done during the Node.js course by Max. 

- App stuff: https://github.com/sanjar-notes/nodejs/tree/main/home/4_resource_itineraries/2_Node_js_complete_guide_academind/12_Working_with_NoSQL_and_MongoDB
- Usual lang stuff: https://github.com/sanjar-notes/nodejs/tree/main/home/4_resource_itineraries/2_Node_js_complete_guide_academind/12_Working_with_NoSQL_and_MongoDB/extras
