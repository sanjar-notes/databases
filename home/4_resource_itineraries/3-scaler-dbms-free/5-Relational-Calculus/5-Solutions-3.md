C and D are wrong sentences. B is wrong. So A is the answer.

Make the general two-touch diagram, then try to max the expression. Consider 2-touch, R subset of S, S subset of R. For maximizing, we need to avoid potential subtraction no matter what, so one has to be a subset of the other (since otherwise some value of R). This way min(r, s) becomes the answer, and no subtraction takes place.

Ignore the tables initially. Just look at the query, and pick out wrong ones. B and C are wrong since there's no mention of count (being <= 1 or == 1). 'A' seems to be correct, and since the words are used in the general sense, A is correct.

A is wrong. C is correct. And I don't know what B means. The answer is just C btw. GPT says "domain" here means "domain of application". Then, B is wrong since both languages are general purpose query languages. **Important.**
