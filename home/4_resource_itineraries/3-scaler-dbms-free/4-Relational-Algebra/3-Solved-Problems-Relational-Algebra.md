1. Just evaluate the expression. Only imp thing is being careful. ![](../../../../assets/3-Solved-Problems-Relational-Algebra-image-1-276a499c.png)
2. No need to do decompose in fundamentals etc. Since it's asking NOT equivalent, so check which one may have missing or extra rows (only possibilities for non equivalence here). Answer is 3 since it has extra rows from r.  ![](../../../../assets/3-Solved-Problems-Relational-Algebra-image-2-276a499c.png)
3. Simple evalutation ![](../../../../assets/3-Solved-Problems-Relational-Algebra-image-3-276a499c.png)
4. Simple evaluation. Find out the first value, i.e. R. Then pick out wrong options. ![](../../../../assets/3-Solved-Problems-Relational-Algebra-image-4-276a499c.png)
5. It's a simple fact that foreign keys are a subset of the source table. So (dependent - source) is empty. ![](../../../../assets/3-Solved-Problems-Relational-Algebra-image-5-276a499c.png)
