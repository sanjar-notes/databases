- Prefer using the official documentation for the database and the exact version of it. This is almost always guaranteed to be *exhaustive* and *correct*. May be not be very readable. Example:

	- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/index.html
- For easy accessibility's sake - 3rd party sites like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) are quite easy to go through.
